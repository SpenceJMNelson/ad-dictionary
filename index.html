<h1>Dictionary Project Materials</h1>
    <h6>About the dictionary</h6>
    <p>
    This dictionary will pull together words that represent and reflect some ideas and facts which underpin my app project. The format that this dictionary will take is an interactive website using a unique navigation system that organizes and draws connections between words. Words representing play, scientific facts, and deeper philosophical ideas will be visually catenated such that user can start to imagine pathways from one of these modes of interaction to the other. Play hooks a user, inspiring them to learn a set of facts, and these facts as a whole will hopefully lead to deeper understanding about an individual's place in the world. Ultimately this is the goal of the app itself: To function first as a mode of play, second as resource for learning a set of facts, and third as a catalysy for deeper philosophical thought.
